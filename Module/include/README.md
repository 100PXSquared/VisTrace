# VisTrace Includes

These files can be included without any dependencies for use in your own projects, allowing you to interface with VisTrace objects on the stack  

Use `GetProcAddress` to get metatable type IDs from the VisTrace dll. These are declared in the respective object's header file, and will be -1 if invalid
