                                   **VisTracing in One Weekend**
                      Inspired by [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley)

Introduction
============
Many people have written ray tracers in Garry's Mod, but few have explored the more serious side of light transport, reserving themselves to basic lighting models and guesswork. With VisTracing in One Weekend I hope to provide a gateway into the wider field of light transport, while remaining in GMod and assuming only a minimal understanding of ray tracing.  

If you're entirely unfamiliar with ray tracing, specifically ray tracing in GMod, I would recommend you read Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend which is linked above, and is the inspiration for this book.  

By the end of each section you should have a solid groundwork to either move into the next section with, or to develop onto yourself. And by the end of the book you'll have a pretty decent tracer.

\begin{equation}
L_o(\mathbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) = L_e(\mathbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) + \int_{\Omega} f_r(\mathbf{x}, \omega_i, \omega_o, \lambda, t)L_i(\mathbf{x}, \omega_i, \lambda, t)(\omega_i \cdot \mathbf{n}) \,d\omega_i
